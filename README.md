## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach you how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I create with my course on Udemy [Flutter-BootCamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

A dice app that when we click on any dice it changes face.
